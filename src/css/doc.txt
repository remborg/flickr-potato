Always 
    Start general.
    Move towards specifics as slowly as possible.
    Never divide based on any external concepts (type/layout, screen-sizes, etc).

Folder structure
================

Base
----
imports and settings - no CSS output.
  - e.g _grid, _colors, _rhythm, etc.

General
-------
Initial CSS baseline with resets, defaults, font imports, and classes to extend.
  - e.g. _reset, _root, _fonts, _icons, _defaults, etc.

Layout
------
The rough outline of the site structure. Not "layout" as a set of properties excluding type, "layout" as the overall site template which might well include typography. 
  - e.g. _banner, _nav, _main, _contentinfo, etc.

Modules
-------
All the details. First by effect (classes/general), then by widget (ids/specifics).
  - e.g. _users, _admin, _product-lists etc.

Plugins
-------
3rd-party code

Overrides
---------
to handle unavoidable location-specific overrides to a widget.
